# dj-remix

We are going to make mash ups of some epic songs!

---
The activity is going to require you to:
1. Clone this repo to a folder on your computer.
2. Make your own branch using the naming convention 'dj_<<name>>_branch' (for example: 'dj_matt_branch') The terminal command is "**git checkout -b dj_matt_branch**"
3. Once you have your own branch, create a new .txt text file named after your first or favorite pet. (for example: snoopy.txt)
4. Open a new web browser tab and find the verse lyrics to one of your favorite songs.
5. Copy the **first verse** into the text file and save your changes.
6. Add the changed file to git using the terminal command " git add . "
7. Commit the changes to git using the terminal command " git commit -m <<and a message here>> "
8. Push your changes up to your branch. Then git checkout back to main on your local.

#### Take a Dance Break
---

9. Practice merging your branch into main (there should be no merge conflicts because we all made our own new text file).
10. Practice pulling main with everyone else's new text files down into your local main.
11. Git checkout back to your branch. Pull the new main changes into your branch by typing " git pull origin main " in the terminal. You should see others' text files.
12. Here we will pick a different person's text file--one we haven't seen yet! There should be a mystery song verse that is missing a chorus...
13. Go back to your web browser and pick another song that you love. Search for the lyrics to it's chorus and copy and paste them into the text file.
14. Save your changes!
15. Repeat steps 6-9, including the dance break. If we all chose different text files, we should not have merge conflicts. **HOWEVER** if two people chose the same text files, we might be trying to add two choruses after the first person's verse. That's ok. We will add both to the song and merge our changes into main.
16. Can continue with verses and choruses as needed for practice--Let's make some music!
